		A permutation cipher is a twist on the classic Caesar cipher. Instead of translating between two
		alphabets with one shifted from the other, your second alphabet is randomly arranged. This
		increases the number of possible alphabets from 26 to 403291461100000000000000000, or roughly
		four hundred and three septillion. A circle that many meters wide is comparable to the size of
		the observable universe.
