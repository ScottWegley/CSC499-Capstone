		This website was created as my capstone project for my Bachelors Degree. It was made during my
		final undergraduate semester at California Lutheran University in Spring of 2024. I developed it
		under the advisement of Dr. Chang-Shyh Peng, the Computer Science department chair at the time,
		with inspiration from Dr. Craig Reinhart, the former chair and one of my recurring professors. I
		decided to create a webapp primarily because my experience with web development is incredibly
		limited and informal. I plan to end up in Cybersecurity for my career, and that requires being
		familiar with a number of different environments from mobile to desktop to web. This seemed the
		perfect oppurtunity to expose myself to an environment I was less experienced in. I additionally
		decided to make the theme and subject of the website Cybersecurity, with a focus on
		Cryptography. Categorizing and collating information that I feel I know has proven an excellent
		way for me to verify my own knowledge, and this seemed like a great chance to do that. This page
		hosts a number of the documents I created during the development process, all of which you are
		welcome to and encouraged to view.
