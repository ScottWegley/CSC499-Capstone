			This website was created as my capstone project for my Bachelors Degree. It was made during my
			final undergraduate semester at California Lutheran University in Spring of 2024. I developed
			it under the advisement of Dr. Chang-Shyh Peng, the Computer Science department chair at the
			time, with inspiration from Dr. Craig Reinhart, the former chair and one of my recurring
			professors. I decided to create a webapp primarily because my experience with web development
			is incredibly limited and informal. I plan to end up in Cybersecurity for my career, and that
			requires being familiar with a number of different environments from mobile to desktop to web.
			This seemed the perfect oppurtunity to expose myself to an environment I was less experienced
			in. I additionally decided to make the theme and subject of the website Cybersecurity, with a
			focus on Cryptography. Categorizing and collating information that I feel I know has proven an
			excellent way for me to verify my own knowledge, and this seemed like a great chance to do
			that. This page hosts a number of the documents I created during the development process, all
			of which you are welcome to and encouraged to view.
